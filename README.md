The purpose of this project is to create a simple microservice using the Spring Boot Framework capable of providing information relating to certain teams in the Madden 23 NFL Video Game. To start out, there will be three microservices corresponding to a catalog of all teams in the game, information about each team specifically, as well as how well the teams are rated.
